## 🦍 Shares of the 1903 Prize in Physics
You want to examine the laureates of the 1903 prize in physics and how they split the prize. Here is a query without projection:

    db.laureates.find_one({"prizes": {"$elemMatch": {"category": "physics", "year": "1903"}}})
  
> Which projection(s) will fetch ***ONLY*** the laureates' full names and prize share info? I encourage you to experiment with the console and re-familiarize yourself with the structure of laureate collection documents.
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes"]
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes.share"]
- [x] {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "prizes.share": 1, "_id": 0}
- [ ] All of the above

## 🦍 Rounding up the G.S. crew
    { "name": {$regex: "^Py"}    }
will fetch documents where the field 'name' ***starts with "Py".***

> In this exercise, you will use regular expressions, projection, and list comprehension to collect the full names of laureates whose initials are "G.S.".

- [x] 1) First, use regular expressions to fetch the documents for the laureates whose "firstname" starts with "G" and whose "surname" starts with 
         "S".
- [x] 2) Use projection and adjust the query to select only the "firstname" and "surname" fields.
- [x] 3) Iterate over the documents, and for each document, concatenate the first name and the surname fields together with a space in between to obtain full names.

```py
# Find laureates whose first name starts with "G" and last name starts with "S"
docs = db.laureates.find(
       filter= {"firstname" : {"$regex" : "^G"},
                "surname" : {"$regex" : "^S"}  })
# Print the first document 
print(docs[0])
```
```py
# Use projection to select only firstname and surname
docs = db.laureates.find(
    filter={"firstname": {"$regex": "^G"},
            "surname": {"$regex": "^S"}},
    projection=["firstname", "surname"])


# Print the first document
print(docs[0])
```
```py
# Use projection to select only firstname and surname
docs = db.laureates.find(
       filter= {"firstname" : {"$regex" : "^G"},
                "surname" : {"$regex" : "^S"}  },
   projection= ["firstname", "surname"]  )

# Iterate over docs and concatenate first name and surname
full_names = [doc["firstname"] + " " + doc["surname"]  for doc in docs]

# Print the full names
print(full_names)
```
## 🦍 Doing our share of data validation
Each "laureates.share" value appears to be the reciprocal of a laureate's fractional share of that prize, encoded as a string. For example, a laureate "share" of "4" means that this laureate received a 
 
 share of the prize. Let's check that for each prize, all the shares of all the laureates add up to 1!
 - [x] Save a list of prizes (prizes), projecting out only the "laureates.share" values for each prize.
 - [x] For each prize, compute the total share as follows:
 - [x] Initialize the variable total_share to 0.
 - [x] Iterate over the laureates for each prize, converting the "share" field of the "laureate" to float and adding the reciprocal of it (that is, 1 divided by it) to total_share.
 ```py
 # Save documents, projecting out laureates share
prizes = db.prizes.find({}, ["laureates.share"])

# Iterate over prizes
for prize in prizes:
    # Initialize total share
    total_share = 0

    # Iterate over laureates for the prize
    for laureate in prize["laureates"]:
        # add the share of the laureate to total_share
        total_share += 1 / float(laureate['share'])

    # Print the total share
    print(total_share)
```

## 🦍 What the sort?
> This block prints out the first five projections of a sorted query. What "sort" argument fills the blank?
```py
docs = list(db.laureates.find(
    {"born": {"$gte": "1900"}, "prizes.year": {"$gte": "1954"}},
    {"born": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0},
    sort=____))
for doc in docs[:5]:
    print(doc)
```
    {'born': '1916-08-25', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}]}
    {'born': '1915-06-15', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}]}
    {'born': '1901-02-28', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}, {'year': '1962'}]}
    {'born': '1913-07-12', 'prizes': [{'year': '1955'}]}
    {'born': '1911-01-26', 'prizes': [{'year': '1955'}]}
Possible Answers
- [x] [("prizes.year", 1), ("born", -1)]

docs = list(db.laureates.find(
    {"born": {"$gte": "1900"}, "prizes.year": {"$gte": "1954"}},
    {"born": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0},
    sort=[("prizes.year", 1), ("born", -1)]))
